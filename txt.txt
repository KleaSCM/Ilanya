    Currently, trait buffs are stored, but no logic re-injects them into the trait engine or updates upstream desires from goal progress.

    Consider adding a reinforce_traits() and reinforce_desires() method that triggers reinforcement through the trait engine interface if present.

Nash Equilibrium Logic

    nash_equilibrium_weight is defined but not computed. If you plan to implement game-theoretic goal coordination, you might want a separate equilibrium solver module (e.g., for multi-agent planning or self vs. partner agent goal conflict).

Entropy Contribution

    You store entropy_contribution, which is fascinating — but I don’t see usage yet. Consider defining how this value is updated: maybe based on the predictability, resource pressure, or structural divergence of the goal.
