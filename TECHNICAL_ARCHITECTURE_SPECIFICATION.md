lanya AI Agent Architecture - Technical Specification:
The Ilanya AI Agent Architecture implements a multi-stage cognitive processing pipeline that transforms natural language input into structured personality evolution 
through interconnected neural networks and mathematical control systems.
The system initiates with natural language input that undergoes processing through a neural trait mapping system. This component employs transformer-based neural networks utilizing
the sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model as the foundational encoder.
The mapping system implements cross-attention mechanisms that establish relationships between text input and personality trait modifications through attention weights
A(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V, where Q represents query vectors from text embeddings, K represents key vectors from trait embeddings, and V represents value vectors.
The system operates within a 54-dimensional trait space T ∈ ℝ^54, mapping each natural language input x to trait modification signals δT through the function f: X → ℝ^54, 
where X represents the input text space. The mapping incorporates confidence scores c ∈ [0,1]^54 that determine modification application through threshold filtering:
δT_i = δT_i if c_i > τ, else 0, where τ = 0.7 is the confidence threshold. The neural trait mapping system processes text input with maximum sequence length
L = 128 tokens, converting natural language into trait modification signals through the transformation x → δT.
The architecture employs multi-head attention with H = 8 heads and N = 3 transformer layers, creating representations through the function
h_l = TransformerLayer(h_{l-1}) for l ∈ {1,...,N}. The embedding dimension combines d_text = 384 dimensions for text processing with d_trait = 64 dimensions for trait representation, 
resulting in a combined space of dimension d_combined = d_text + d_trait = 448. The system processes these modifications through a neural trait engine utilizing a TraitTransformer architecture with
L_engine = 6 layers and H_engine = 8 attention heads. The engine implements identity preservation loss functions that apply differential penalties: 
L_identity = Σ_i w_i ||T_i - T_i'||², where w_i = 50 for permanently protected traits, w_i = 10 for partially protected traits, and w_i = 1 for fully evolvable traits. 
This ensures core identity characteristics remain stable under extreme conditions through the constraint ||T_protected - T_protected'|| < ε, where ε is a small tolerance value.
The trait engine processes TraitData objects containing 54 trait dimensions, generating predicted trait values T_pred ∈ ℝ^54, evolution signals E ∈ ℝ^54, and interaction weights W ∈ ℝ^{54×54}
that describe trait relationships through the matrix equation T_new = T_current + W × E. The system operates with hidden dimension d_hidden = 1024 and employs dropout rate p = 0.1 
to prevent overfitting through the regularization term L_reg = λ||W||². Protection levels are implemented at three tiers: permanently protected traits receive penalty weight w_p = 50,
partially protected traits receive w_p = 10, and fully evolvable traits receive w_p = 1. The entire system leverages CUDA acceleration when available to maintain real-time processing capabilities,
achieving computational complexity O(n²d) for attention mechanisms and O(nd²) for feedforward layers, where n is sequence length and d is embedding dimension.


The desire engine represents the next stage in the cognitive pipeline, creating and activating desires based on trait activations through the transformation
D = f_desire(T_activated), where T_activated ∈ ℝ^54 represents activated trait states. This modular architecture incorporates threshold, temporal,
 and interaction modules that compute desire strength through the function S_d = σ(W_d T_activated + b_d), where W_d ∈ ℝ^{n_d × 54}, n_d is the number of desires,
  and σ is the sigmoid activation function. The system implements reinforcement mechanisms through the differential equation dS_d/dt = α(S_target - S_current) + βR, 
  where α is the learning rate, β is the reinforcement coefficient, and R represents reinforcement signals.
The desire engine processes trait activation states with confidence scores c ∈ [0,1]^54, generating desire reinforcement signals R ∈ ℝ^{n_d}, strength updates ΔS_d ∈ ℝ^{n_d},
 and goal candidates G_candidate ∈ ℝ^{n_g}. The system performs real-time trait activation analysis utilizing Shannon entropy H = -Σ_i p_i log(p_i), 
 where p_i represents the probability distribution of trait activations, complexity measures C = ||∇T_activated||², and interaction counts I = Σ_{i,j} |W_{i,j}|. 
 This analysis enables identification of high-strength desires through the threshold condition S_d > τ_d, where τ_d is the desire strength threshold.
The goals engine implements a GoalFormationInterface with field-like attraction dynamics modeled by the potential function V(G) = Σ_i k_i ||G - G_i||², 
where G represents goal states, G_i are attractor points, and k_i are attraction coefficients. The system employs Nash equilibrium calculations to resolve goal competition through
the optimization problem min Σ_i u_i(G) subject to G ∈ G_feasible, where u_i represents utility functions for competing goals.
 Nash equilibrium is achieved when no goal can unilaterally improve its utility: u_i(G) ≥ u_i(G_i, G_{-i}) for all i and G_i.


Lyapunov stability analysis provides mathematical guarantees through the Lyapunov function V(x) = x^T P x, where P is a positive definite matrix, ensuring dV/dt < 0 for all x ≠ 0. 
Temporal stability requirements enforce thresholds Δt > 300 seconds (five minutes) through the constraint |G(t) - G(t-Δt)| < ε_temporal, where ε_temporal is the temporal stability tolerance.
The system implements multi-objective optimization with Pareto frontier analysis through the vector optimization problem min [f_1(G), f_2(G), ..., f_m(G)] subject to G ∈ G_feasible,
where f_i represent competing objective functions.The mathematical framework implements identity preservation through the constrained optimization problem 
min L_total subject to ||T_protected - T_protected'|| < ε_identity, where ε_identity is the identity preservation tolerance. 
Protection levels are implemented through differential penalty weights w_p ∈ {50, 10, 1} for permanently protected, partially protected, and fully evolvable traits respectively.
The stability controls implement Nash equilibrium resolution through iterative best-response dynamics: G_i^{t+1} = argmax u_i(G_i, G_{-i}^t), ensuring convergence to stable equilibrium states.
Lyapunov stability analysis provides mathematical guarantees through the condition that the Jacobian matrix J = ∂f/∂x has all eigenvalues with negative real parts. 
Field attraction dynamics model desire-to-goal evolution through the differential equation dG/dt = -∇V(G) + η(t), where η(t) represents stochastic perturbations.

Trait evolution mechanics operate with base evolution rate α_base = 0.01, modified by plasticity constraints p ∈ [0,1] through the equation α_effective = α_base × p. 
Interaction weights create relationship matrix W ∈ ℝ^{54×54} capturing trait influences through the equation T_new = T_current + W × E, where E represents evolution signals.
Confidence propagation ensures uncertainty quantification through the variance propagation equation σ²out = J^T Σ_in J, where J is the Jacobian matrix and Σ_in represents input covariance.
The system integration creates a pipeline with data flow T_input → T_mapped → T_evolved → D_activated → G_formed → C_context, where each arrow represents a transformation function.
Real-time processing capabilities achieve throughput R = 100+ words/minute with latency L < 1 second per input, supporting batch processing with complexity O(b × n²d) for batch size b.
Protection mechanisms operate through multi-level validation: neural network training with identity preservation loss L_identity = Σ_i w_i ||T_i - T_i'||²,
runtime constraint checking through the condition ||T_protected - T_protected'|| < ε_runtime, and fallback mechanisms that implement automatic rollback when ||T_protected - T_protected'|| > ε_critical.

System stability is maintained through mathematical controls enforcing Nash equilibrium and Lyapunov stability, threshold management with configurable limits L_min ≤ x ≤ L_max for all parameters x,
error recovery through graceful degradation with comprehensive logging, and state validation through continuous verification of system state consistency.
Computational requirements include two transformer networks with L = 6+ layers each, memory usage M ≈ 500MB for model weights and state tracking, CUDA acceleration for optimal performance,
and storage S ≈ 100MB for model files and configuration data. Scalability metrics demonstrate O(n) complexity for input processing, O(1) per trait for trait evolution across 54 traits,
O(n_d) for desire processing with n_d active desires, and O(n_g²) for goal formation with n_g competing goals.
